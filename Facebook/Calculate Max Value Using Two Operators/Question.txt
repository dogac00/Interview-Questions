Calculate maximum value using ‘+’ or ‘*’ sign between two numbers in a string
Given a string of numbers, the task is to find the maximum value from the string, 
you can add a ‘+’ or ‘*’ sign between any two numbers.

Examples:

Input : 01231
Output : 
((((0 + 1) + 2) * 3) + 1) = 10
In above manner, we get the maximum value i.e. 10

Input : 891
Output :73
As 8*9*1 = 72 and 8*9+1 = 73.So, 73 is maximum.
